# ArduboySimpleIdleCash

A quick weekend project used to teach my son programming.  
Just press the A or B to spend the cash and watch it pile up.  

Cash increases slowly at first.
Buildings cost $1000 more than last building
Towers cost 100 buildings more than last tower
Cites cost 30 towers more than last city
